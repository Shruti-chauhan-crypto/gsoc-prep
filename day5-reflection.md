# Day 5 Reflection

## What did I learn about Pull Requests?
Today, I learned about Pull Requests (PRs) and why they are important in open-source contributions. Instead of directly committing changes to the main branch, contributors create a PR so that maintainers can review the code and decide whether it should be merged. This process helps maintain code quality and collaboration.

## Practical experience with my own repository
I created a Pull Request in my own repository by making changes in a separate branch. I added a proper title and description to the PR and then reviewed and merged it as a maintainer. This helped me understand the complete PR workflow, including branching, reviewing changes, and merging code.

## What I understood from this process
I realized that a good Pull Request should clearly explain what changes were made and why they were necessary. Practicing this process reduced my fear of PRs and made me more confident about contributing to open-source projects.
