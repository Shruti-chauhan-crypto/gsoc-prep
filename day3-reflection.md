# Day 3 Reflection

## What did you learn today?
Today, I explored the GitHub Issues section and learned that issues are used to track bugs, improvements, and discussions in open-source projects. I also realized that some issues are onboarding guides rather than actual bugs.

## What felt confusing or challenging?
I felt confused while navigating the Issues section and understanding which issues are real beginner-friendly problems. Reading issue descriptions without enough context made it difficult to understand what action was required.

## What is your next step?
My next step is to learn more about GitHub Issues through tutorials and examples. I want to understand how to read issues properly before trying to pick one to work on.
