# gsoc-prep

Hi, my name is **Shruti Chauhan**, and I am currently a **B.Tech 2nd-year student**. I am passionate about technology and actively building a strong foundation in programming.

I have started my journey in **open source** to gain real-world experience, understand how collaborative software development works, and improve my problem-solving skills.

**Google Summer of Code 2026** is a great opportunity for me to contribute to meaningful projects while learning from experienced mentors. I am aiming to become a consistent and responsible open source contributor before applying to GSoC 2026.

My primary focus will be on **Python**, where I plan to:
- Improve my coding skills
- Read and understand existing codebases
- Make meaningful contributions to real-world projects

This repository documents my learning, progress, and preparation for open source and GSoC.
