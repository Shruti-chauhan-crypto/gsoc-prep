#DAY-2-Reflection

## What new Python concept did you use today?
- Today, I worked with dictionaries and learned about their different methods such as `.values()`, `.keys()`, `.items()`. I created functions like **analyze_marks(marks_dict)** and **word_frequency(sentence)**, and learned how to calculate highest, lowest, and average values using loops. I also understood how splitting a sentence helps in counting word frequency.
- I also read someone else's repository to improve my code-reading and debugging skills.

## What confused you today?
- Initially, I was confused between word frequency and character frequency. Reading the code carefully helped me understand my mistake.
- While reading others' code, I found the use of the **pprint** module confusing because I had not used it before and was unfamiliar with its purpose.

## What felt easy?
- Writing basic functions and using loops felt comfortable. Fixing errors after feedback was easier than writing the code for the first time.
- I learned that **pprint** stands for *pretty print*. It is a built-in Python module used to print complex data structures, such as dictionaries and lists, in a well-formatted and readable way.
