# Day 4 Reflection

## What did I learn today?
Today, I learned Git and GitHub in detail, including important commands such as `init`, `branch`, `push`, `fetch`, and `pull`. I also learned the difference between Git and GitHub and how they work together in open-source development.

## Which Git command felt confusing?
The branch command felt confusing because it involves different concepts like merging and handling conflicts. However, by practicing patiently, I was able to understand it better and improve my knowledge.

## What improved compared to earlier?
Earlier, I was very confused about the different functionalities of GitHub. Now, I have a clearer understanding of how GitHub works and how it is used for version control and collaboration.
